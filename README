Company Profile Extraction using LangChain & Cohere
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a structured information extraction pipeline using LangChain, Cohere LLM, and Pydantic.
The application takes a company name as input, fetches relevant data from Wikipedia, and extracts key company details in a validated, structured format.

The focus of this project is on:

Document loading

Prompt engineering

Output parsing and validation

Reliable LLM pipelines (not free-form text)

🎯 Features

🔍 Fetches company information directly from Wikipedia

🧠 Uses Cohere LLM for intelligent data extraction

🧩 Enforces a strict output schema using Pydantic

📄 Produces consistent, structured company profiles

⚙️ Built using modern LangChain runnable pipelines

🧪 Extracted Company Fields

The application extracts and validates the following fields:

Company Name

Founder(s)

Founded Date

Revenue

Number of Employees

4-Line Company Summary

Missing information is handled safely using optional fields.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
Core Framework

LangChain – LLM orchestration and pipelines

LLM Provider

Cohere – Language model backend

Model used: command-r-08-2024

Data Loading

WikipediaLoader (LangChain Community)

Output Validation

Pydantic – Schema definition and runtime validation

Environment

Google Colab – Execution environment & secret management

📦 Installation

Install all required dependencies:

pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-cohere pydantic wikipedia

🔑 API Key Setup (Cohere)

Set your Cohere API key as an environment variable.

Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

Open Colab → 🔑 Secrets

Add a secret:

Name: COHERE_API_KEY

Value: your Cohere API key

Then load it in code:

import os
from google.colab import userdata

os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("COHERE_API_KEY")

Option 2: Local / Temporary Setup
import os
os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY"

🚀 How to Run the Project

Install dependencies

Configure the Cohere API key

Run the notebook cells in order

Enter a company name when prompted

Example input:

Google


Example output:

Company Name : Google
Founder      : Larry Page, Sergey Brin
Founded Date : 1998
Revenue      : USD 307 billion (2023)
Employees    : ~182,000

Summary:
1. Google is a multinational technology company.
2. It specializes in internet-related services and products.
3. The company operates under Alphabet Inc.
4. Google is a global leader in search and AI technologies.
